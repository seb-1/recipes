# pumpkin (sweet-sour)

850g diced pumpkin (about 2cm)

Bring to a boil:
- 700ml water
- 15 cloves
- 12 cm cinnamon
- 7pcs. Ginger (1pc ~ 2cm)
- 3 teaspoons sugar

Add pumpkin, cook for 5-10 minutes until nearly done (shouldn't be too soft!)

Add 400g sugar

Finally, add 200ml vinegar and heat up (maybe until boiling, but probably not necessary).

Fill into hot preserving jars
